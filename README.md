Testable
========

A set of libs to make things more testable. Each lib allows you to loosen one kind of coupling or make one type of code be context-neutral.

Current ideas:

* Events (real events should support assertions about binding & event firing).
* MVVM
* The SimulatableAPIs

Everything will integrate with FluentAssertions & ReSharper. You can use things without those, but the experience will be blah.
